[Gropher][link]{:target="_blank"} was a side project started at Startup Weekend. Gropher was an on-demand grocery-shopping app, letting users select a store, order ahead, and pick up their order without leaving their car.  For this project, I served as project manager and business developer.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
