[Gropher][flat-icons-link]{:target="_blank"} was a side project I pitched twice, at Startup Weekend and 3 Day Startup. Gropher was an on-demand grocery-shopping platform, letting users select a store, order ahead, and pick up their order without leaving their car.

For this project, I served as project manager and business developer.
