In May of 2015, I organized Seattle's first hackathon for cannabis technology, [GrassRoots Hackathon][flat-icons-link]{:target="_blank"}. Developers, designers, and "non-technicals" came together for a weekend of creativity and collaboration as they raced against the clock to try and launch a startup in a weekend.

As the founder and lead organizer, I was responsible for the entirety of the event, including securing sponsors and venue, finding mentors and judges, and everything else that goes into organizing a weekend-long event.
