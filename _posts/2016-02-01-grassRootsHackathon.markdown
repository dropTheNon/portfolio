In May of 2015, I organized Seattle's first hackathon for cannabis technology, [GrassRoots Hackathon][link]{:target="_blank"}. As the founder and lead organizer, I was responsible for the entirety of the event, including securing sponsors and venue, finding mentors and judges, and everything else that goes into organizing a weekend-long event.

Technologies used: WordPress, BrownPaperTickets.com, PayPal, Google Drive, Google Hangouts
