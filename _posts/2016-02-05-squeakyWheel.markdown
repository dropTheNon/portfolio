[SqueakyWheel][flat-icons-link]{:target="_blank"} was a group project we worked on as part of General Assembly's 12-week Web Development Immersive. Our group created the digital version of a complaint box - users can create a complaint about a company or product, or "upvote" an existing complaint, and we send an email or tweet to the appropriate party on their behalf.

For this project I served as our Project Manager and Git Master, as well as doing some back-end work.
