[SqueakyWheel][link]{:target="_blank"} was a group class project. Our group created the digital version of a complaint box - users can create a complaint about a company or product, or "upvote" an existing complaint, and we send an email or tweet to the appropriate party on their behalf.  For this project I served as our Project Manager, Git Master, and did back-end development.

Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, D3.js, Cloudinary
